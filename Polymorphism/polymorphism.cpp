                                  POLYMORPHISM                         
    There are two types of polymorphism:-

    1->  Compile time polymorphism:- Also known as early binding polymorphism
            Compile time polymorphism in C++ is achieved by two ways:
             1. Function overloading
             2. Operator Overloading 

    2->  Run time polymorphism:-  It is acheived by Virtual functions
